# Personal README Assignment

## What You're Building

A personal README that helps others understand how to work with you best. Think of this as your "user manual" for teammates and instructors.

## Requirements

Your personal README must include:
- At least **2 pictures**
- At least **1 list** (bulleted or numbered)
- **Headings** to organize your content (use `#`, `##`, `###`)
- At least **300 words** of meaningful content
- Keep it **professional** - this could be shared with future employers!

## What to Include

Here are some ideas for what to write about (choose what works for you):
- **About Me** - Your background, what brings you to Code Differently
- **My Learning Style** - How you learn best, what helps you succeed
- **Working With Me** - Communication preferences, when you work best, what motivates you
- **My Goals** - What you hope to accomplish in this program
- **Interests & Hobbies** - Things you enjoy outside of coding
- **Fun Facts** - Anything interesting about yourself!

## How to Add Images

1. Create an `images/` folder in your repository
2. Add your image files to that folder (drag and drop or use "Add file" → "Upload files")
3. Reference them in your README like this:
```markdown
   ![Description of image](images/your-image-name.jpg)
```

## Markdown Basics

- `# Heading 1` - Main title
- `## Heading 2` - Section heading
- `### Heading 3` - Subsection heading
- `**bold text**` - Makes text bold
- `- item` or `* item` - Creates bullet points
- `1. item` - Creates numbered lists
